#### Question 1

**Calculate the dot product $u.v$ where $u = [0.5; 0.5]$ and $v = [3; -4]$.**  

To take the dot product we'll use the formula: $v.w = v_{1}w_{1} + v_{2}w_{2} + v_{3}w_{3} + ... + v_{n}w_{n}$  

Therefore, for our example we will do the following:  

$u.v = (0.5 * 3) + (0.5 * -4)$  
$u.v = (1.5) + (-2)$  
$u.v = -0.5$  

> The dot product of $u.v$ is -0.5.

#### Question 2

**What are the lengths of $u$ and $v$? Please note that the mathematical notion of length of a vector is not the same as a computer science definition.**  

In order to find the length of $u$ and $v$, we'll have to use the following equation: $||a|| = \sqrt{(\vec{a_{1}})^{2} + (\vec{a_{2}})^{2} }$  

Which for our question is:  

$||u|| = \sqrt{0.5^{2} + 0.5^{2}}$  
$||u|| = \sqrt{0.25 + 0.25}$  
$||u|| = \sqrt{0.5}$  
$||u|| = 0.70710678$  

$||v|| = \sqrt{3^{2} + -4^{2}}$  
$||v|| = \sqrt{9 + 16}$  
$||v|| = \sqrt{25}$  
$||v|| = 5$  

> The length of $u$ is $\sqrt{0.5}$ or ~0.707106. The length of $v$ is 5.

#### Question 3

**What is the linear combination: $3u - 2v$?**  

To solve this, we substitute for $u$ and $v$:  

$=3[0.5, 0.5] - 2[3, -4]$  
$=[1.5, 1.5] - [6, -8]$  
$=[(1.5 - 6), (1.5 - -8)]$  
$=[-4.5, 9.5]$  

> The linear combination is [-4.5, 9.5].

#### Question 4

**What is the angle between $u$ and $v$?**  

```{r}
acos(-0.1414) * 180/pi
```
